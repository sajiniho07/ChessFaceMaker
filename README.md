## About ##

FaceDetector is a Python class that uses OpenCV to detect faces in a video stream from a webcam. The class can also apply a chess filter on faces detected in the video stream.

## Usage ##

1- Import the FaceDetector class: from face_detector import FaceDetector.

2- Create an instance of the FaceDetector class: fd = FaceDetector().

3- Call the stream_webcam() method to start streaming video from the webcam: fd.stream_webcam()

4- Press the 'C' key to toggle the chess filter on/off

5- Press the 'Q' key to quit the application

## Technologies ##

The following tools were used in this project:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x

## Requirements ##

1- Clone this repository

2- Install OpenCV by running pip install opencv-python-headless

## License ##
